# WaspSrc Engine

<img src="https://github.com/Nozzle-Software/nozzle-waspsrc/blob/master/res/quake-logo.png?raw=true" alt="Alt Text" width="224.5" height="309">

The Official WaspSrc SDK, forked off the quake.x11 engine

## Prequisites
if not already, make sure your system is multi-arch: `sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386` then `sudo apt update`
then, install the required dependencies with:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install \
  gcc-multilib g++-multilib libpng-dev \
  libx11-dev:i386 libxext-dev:i386 \
  python3 scons \
```

** OR **

* if you are on arch linux, the dependency installation process is a little complex, so feel free to execute the `archintall.sh`.
* And, for people on ubuntu, just execute the `ubuntuinstall.sh`.
* oh... also make sure the files have the correct permissions, so use `chmod +x archinstall.sh | ubuntuinstall.sh`
* If you are on windows, the waspsrc engine has not been known to run there, so just use wsl ubuntu :3

*** More support of different operating systems will come soon! ***

## Build Process
* For common operating systems, there is a SConstruct file for compilation, so just use `scons`. for linux specific installations, go to the WaspSrc directory (`./nozzle-waspsrc/WaspSrc`) and run `make wasp | all | (leave empty)`, then execute `./WaspSrc <arguments>`

> [!WARNING]
> Don't even think of compiling with `make` then cleaning with `scons`. It angers me >:(

## Install pak files
install the pak0.pak file from Internet Archive ([here](https://archive.org/download/quake-shareware-pak/PAK0.PAK)), and put it in the `nozzle` folder. (the file had to be removed due to copyright ðŸ’¾. And don't forget to rename the file name into lowercase!)

> [!NOTE]
> when running, if your computer doesn't support /dev/dsp, then execute `./WaspSrc -nosound <arguments>`
